          <h2>Who we are</h2>
          <p>We're currently a team of 5 individuals based out of bangalore and are driven to build an entirely new financial system, one that prioritises its participants over rent-seeking intermediaries. The advent of blockchain technology and its rise in popularity over the past few years opened our eyes to possibilities that we could not have imagined before. We realised there would be a disruption in trust, trust-lessness, and incentive-based economics which led us to question every industry that required said trust. And we came to a conclusion that almost any service or product requiring a middleman could be replaced. Passionate about finance, we started to target and question every single function performed by financial entities and middlemen, from banking and insurance all the way to derivatives and securitisation. We realised each of these functions could be facilitated by code, via smart contracts. We started architecting these alternatives and are steadfast building them as you read this. We realised that an industry that has not been revolutionised in centuries could finally be improved upon, if not replaced. If you're passionate about technology and building impactful products that truly change peoples lives, Join us.</p>
